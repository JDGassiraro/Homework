// Add, commit, and push your JS file to your GitHub repo.

// Send your TA a link to your GitHub Homework repo when finished.
// An example output for this assignment is:
// Welcome to The Pizza House, our toppings are: pepperoni, sausage, onions, peppers, One large thin crust pizza with sausage, onions, peppers, .
// Coming up! ...your pizza is cooking... Order up! Here's your large thin crust pizza with sausage, onions, peppers, . Enjoy!

// //Bonus Challenge
// Figure out how to add "and" before the last topping in a list of toppings so when we list toppings it is more grammatically correct.
//You could create a listToppings function that stores the functionality, and call the function each time we list toppings in a function.
// i.e. "Our toppings are a, b, and c." instead of "Our toppings are a, b, c"
// In getPizzaOrder, if an order is placed with no toppings, print a slightly different message,
// like "One large thick crust cheese pizza coming up!" (Instead of "One large thick crust pizza with coming up!").
// Alter servePizza in a similar way to fix its grammar when serving a "plain" cheese pizza.
// In getPizzaOrder, check the toppings the customer ordered against your list of available toppings.
//If they order a topping you don't offer, print a message that informs them you don't offer that topping and to order again.
